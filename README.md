# RmHelper

We noticed a lot of people inadvertently delete their tweets, or even worse are
getting hacked by malicious entities who take pleasure in removing other's precious data!

Because our world is currently plunged into a complete Mephistophelian dystopia,
we want to help and at least make Twitter a better place, where :heart: and
:couple_with_heart_man_man: prevail over evil and perfidy.
